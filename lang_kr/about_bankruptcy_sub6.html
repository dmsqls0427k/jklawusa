Compare  U.S. trustee.</p>

<p>bankruptcy court -  The bankruptcy judges in regular active service in each district; a unit of the  district court.</p>
<p>bankruptcy estate -  All legal or equitable interests of the debtor in property at the time of the  bankruptcy filing. (The estate includes all property in which the debtor has an  interest, even if it is owned or held by another person.)</p>
<p>bankruptcy judge- A  judicial officer of the United States district court who is the court official  with decision-making power over federal bankruptcy cases.</p>
<p>bankruptcy  petition- The document filed by the debtor (in a voluntary case) or by  creditors (in an involuntary case) by which opens the bankruptcy case. (There  are official forms for bankruptcy petitions.)</p>
<p>C</p>
<p>chapter 7 - The  chapter of the Bankruptcy Code providing for &quot;liquidation,&quot;(i.e., the  sale of a debtor's nonexempt property and the distribution of the proceeds to  creditors.)</p>
<p>chapter 9- The  chapter of the Bankruptcy Code providing for reorganization of municipalities  (which includes cities and towns, as well as villages, counties, taxing  districts, municipal utilities, and school districts).</p>
<p>chapter 11- The  chapter of the Bankruptcy Code providing (generally) for reorganization,  usually involving a corporation or partnership. (A chapter 11 debtor usually  proposes a plan of reorganization to keep its business alive and pay creditors  over time. People in business or individuals can also seek relief in chapter  11.)</p>
<p>chapter 12- The  chapter of the Bankruptcy Code providing for adjustment of debts of a  &quot;family farmer,&quot; or a &quot;family fisherman&quot; as those terms are  defined in the Bankruptcy Code.</p>
<p>chapter 13 - The  chapter of the Bankruptcy Code providing for adjustment of debts of an  individual with regular income. (Chapter 13 allows a debtor to keep property  and pay debts over time, usually three to five years.)</p>
<p>chapter 15 - The  chapter of the Bankruptcy Code dealing with cases of cross-border insolvency.</p>
<p>Claim - A  creditor's assertion of a right to payment from the debtor or the debtor's  property.</p>

<p>Creditor - One to  whom the debtor owes money or who claims to be owed money by the debtor.</p>
<p>credit counseling -  Generally refers to two events in individual bankruptcy cases: (1) the  &quot;individual or group briefing&quot; from a nonprofit budget and credit  counseling agency that individual debtors must attend prior to filing under any  chapter of the Bankruptcy Code; and (2) the &quot;instructional course in  personal financial management&quot; in chapters 7 and 13 that an individual  debtor must complete before a discharge is entered. There are exceptions to  both requirements for certain categories of debtors, exigent circumstances, or  if the U.S. trustee or bankruptcy administrator have determined that there are  insufficient approved credit counseling agencies available to provide the  necessary counseling.</p>
<p>creditors' meeting  - see 341 meeting</p>
<p>current monthly  income - The average monthly income received by the debtor over the six  calendar months before commencement of the bankruptcy case, including regular  contributions to household expenses from nondebtors and income from the  debtor's spouse if the petition is a joint petition, but not including social  security income and certain other payments made because the debtor is the  victim of certain crimes. 11 U.S.C. &sect; 101(10A).</p>

<p>Discharge - A  release of a debtor from personal liability for certain dischargeable debts set  forth in the Bankruptcy Code. (A discharge releases a debtor from personal  liability for certain debts known as dischargeable debts and prevents the  creditors owed those debts from taking any action against the debtor to collect  the debts. The discharge also prohibits creditors from communicating with the  debtor regarding the debt, including telephone calls, letters, and personal  contact.)</p>
<p>dischargeable debt  - A debt for which the Bankruptcy Code allows the debtor's personal liability  to be eliminated.</p>
<p>disclosure  statement - A written document prepared by the chapter 11 debtor or other plan  proponent that is designed to provide &quot;adequate information&quot; to  creditors to enable them to evaluate the chapter 11 plan of reorganization.</p>
<p>E</p>
<p>Equity - The value  of a debtor's interest in property that remains after liens and other  creditors' interests are considered. (Example: If a house valued at $100,000 is  subject to a $80,000 mortgage, there is $20,000 of equity.)</p>
<p>executory contract  or lease - Generally includes contracts or leases under which both parties to  the agreement have duties remaining to be performed. (If a contract or lease is  executory, a debtor may assume it or reject it.)</p>
<p>exemptions, exempt  property - Certain property owned by an individual debtor that the Bankruptcy  Code or applicable state law permits the debtor to keep from unsecured  creditors. For example, in some states the debtor may be able to exempt all or  a portion of the equity in the debtor's primary residence (homestead  exemption), or some or all &quot;tools of the trade&quot; used by the debtor to  make a living (i.e., auto tools for an auto mechanic or dental tools for a  dentist). The availability and amount of property the debtor may exempt depends  on the state the debtor lives in.</p>
<p>F</p>

<p>fresh start - The  characterization of a debtor's status after bankruptcy, i.e., free of most debts.  (Giving debtors a fresh start is one purpose of the Bankruptcy Code.)</p>
<p>I</p>
<p>insider (of  individual debtor) - Any relative of the debtor or of a general partner of the  debtor; partnership in which the debtor is a general partner; general partner  of the debtor; or a corporation of which the debtor is a director, officer, or  person in control.</p>
<p>insider (of  corporate debtor) - A director, officer, or person in control of the debtor; a  partnership in which the debtor is a general partner; a general partner of the  debtor; or a relative of a general partner, director, officer, or person in  control of the debtor.</p>
<p>J</p>
<p>joint  administration - A court-approved mechanism under which two or more cases can  be administered together. (Assuming no conflicts of interest, these separate  businesses or individuals can pool their resources, hire the same  professionals, etc.)</p>
<p>joint petition -  One bankruptcy petition filed by a husband and wife together.</p>
<p>L</p>
<p>Lien - The right to  take and hold or sell the property of a debtor as security or payment for a  debt or duty.</p>
<p>Liquidation - A  sale of a debtor's property with the proceeds to be used for the benefit of  creditors.</p>
<p>liquidated claim -  A creditor's claim for a fixed amount of money.</p>
<p>M</p>
<p>means test -  Section 707(b)(2) of the Bankruptcy Code applies a &quot;means test&quot; to  determine whether an individual debtor's chapter 7 filing is presumed to be an  abuse of the Bankruptcy Code requiring dismissal or conversion of the case  (generally to chapter 13). Abuse is presumed if the debtor's aggregate current  monthly income (see definition above) over 5 years, net of certain statutorily  allowed expenses is more than (i) $10,000, or (ii) 25% of the debtor's  nonpriority unsecured debt, as long as that amount is at least $6,000. The  debtor may rebut a presumption of abuse only by a showing of special  circumstances that justify additional expenses or adjustments of current  monthly income.</p>
<p>motion to lift the  automatic stay - A request by a creditor to allow the creditor to take action  against the debtor or the debtor's property that would otherwise be prohibited  by the automatic stay.</p>
<p>N</p>
<p>no-asset case - A  chapter 7 case where there are no assets available to satisfy any portion of  the creditors' unsecured claims.</p>
<p>nondischargeable  debt - A debt that cannot be eliminated in bankruptcy. Examples include a home  mortgage, debts for alimony or child support, certain taxes, debts for most  government funded or guaranteed educational loans or benefit overpayments,  debts arising from death or personal injury caused by driving while intoxicated  or under the influence of drugs, and debts for restitution or a criminal fine  included in a sentence on the debtor's conviction of a crime. Some debts, such  as debts for money or property obtained by false pretenses and debts for fraud  or defalcation while acting in a fiduciary capacity may be declared  nondischargeable only if a creditor timely files and prevails in a  nondischargeability action.</p>
<p>O</p>
<p>objection to  dischargeability - A trustee's or creditor's objection to the debtor being  released from personal liability for certain dischargeable debts. Common  reasons include allegations that the debt to be discharged was incurred by  false pretenses or that debt arose because of the debtor's fraud while acting  as a fiduciary.</p>
<p>objection to  exemptions - A trustee's or creditor's objection to the debtor's attempt to  claim certain property as exempt from liquidation by the trustee to creditors.</p>
<p>P</p>

<p>postpetition  transfer - A transfer of the debtor's property made after the commencement of  the case.</p>
<p>prebankruptcy  planning - The arrangement (or rearrangement) of a debtor's property to allow  the debtor to take maximum advantage of exemptions. (Prebankruptcy planning  typically includes converting nonexempt assets into exempt assets.)</p>
<p>preference or  preferential debt payment - A debt payment made to a creditor in the 90-day  period before a debtor files bankruptcy (or within one year if the creditor was  an insider) that gives the creditor more than the creditor would receive in the  debtor's chapter 7 case.</p>
<p>presumption of  abuse - see means test</p>
<p>priority - The  Bankruptcy Code's statutory ranking of unsecured claims that determines the  order in which unsecured claims will be paid if there is not enough money to  pay all unsecured claims in full. For example, under the Bankruptcy Code's  priority scheme, money owed to the case trustee or for prepetition alimony  and/or child support must be paid in full before any general unsecured debt  (i.e. trade debt or credit card debt) is paid.</p>
<p>priority claim - An  unsecured claim that is entitled to be paid ahead of other unsecured claims  that are not entitled to priority status. Priority refers to the order in which  these unsecured claims are to be paid.</p>
<p>proof of claim - A  written statement and verifying documentation filed by a creditor that  describes the reason the debtor owes the creditor money. (There is an official  form for this purpose.)</p>
<p>property of the  estate - All legal or equitable interests of the debtor in property as of the  commencement of the case.</p>
<p>R</p>

<p>S</p>
<p>secured creditor -  A creditor holding a claim against the debtor who has the right to take and  hold or sell certain property of the debtor in satisfaction of some or all of  the claim.</p>
<p>secured debt - Debt  backed by a mortgage, pledge of collateral, or other lien; debt for which the  creditor has the right to pursue specific pledged property upon default.  Examples include home mortgages, auto loans and tax liens.</p>
<p>Schedules -  Detailed lists filed by the debtor along with (or shortly after filing) the  petition showing the debtor's assets, liabilities, and other financial  information. (There are official forms a debtor must use.)</p>
<p>small business case  - A special type of chapter 11 case in which there is no creditors' committee  (or the creditors' committee is deemed inactive by the court) and in which the  debtor is subject to more oversight by the U.S. trustee than other chapter 11  debtors. The Bankruptcy Code contains certain provisions designed to reduce the  time a small business debtor is in bankruptcy.</p>
<p>statement of  financial affairs - A series of questions the debtor must answer in writing  concerning sources of income, transfers of property, lawsuits by creditors,  etc. (There is an official form a debtor must use.)</p>
<p>statement of  intention - A declaration made by a chapter 7 debtor concerning plans for  dealing with consumer debts that are secured by property of the estate.</p>
<p>substantive  consolidation - Putting the assets and liabilities of two or more related  debtors into a single pool to pay creditors. (Courts are reluctant to allow  substantive consolidation since the action must not only justify the benefit  that one set of creditors receives, but also the harm that other creditors  suffer as a result.)</p>
<p>341 meeting - The  meeting of creditors required by section 341 of the Bankruptcy Code at which  the debtor is questioned under oath by creditors, a trustee, examiner, or the  U.S. trustee about his/her financial affairs. Also called creditors' meeting.</p>

<p>Transfer - Any mode  or means by which a debtor disposes of or parts with his/her property.</p>
<p>Trustee - The  representative of the bankruptcy estate who exercises statutory powers,  principally for the benefit of the unsecured creditors, under the general  supervision of the court and the direct supervision of the U.S. trustee or  bankruptcy administrator. The trustee is a private individual or corporation  appointed in all chapter 7, chapter 12, and chapter 13 cases and some chapter  11 cases. The trustee's responsibilities include reviewing the debtor's  petition and schedules and bringing actions against creditors or the debtor to  recover property of the bankruptcy estate. In chapter 7, the trustee liquidates  property of the estate, and makes distributions to creditors. Trustees in  chapter 12 and 13 have similar duties to a chapter 7 trustee and the additional  responsibilities of overseeing the debtor's plan, receiving payments from  debtors, and disbursing plan payments to creditors.</p>
<p>U</p>
<p>U.S. trustee - An  officer of the Justice Department responsible for supervising the  administration of bankruptcy cases, estates, and trustees; monitoring plans and  disclosure statements; monitoring creditors' committees; monitoring fee  applications; and performing other statutory duties. Compare, bankruptcy  administrator.</p>
<p>undersecured claim  - A debt secured by property that is worth less than the full amount of the  debt.</p>
<p>unliquidated claim  - A claim for which a specific value has not been determined.</p>
<p>unscheduled debt -  A debt that should have been listed by the debtor in the schedules filed with  the court but was not. (Depending on the circumstances, an unscheduled debt may  or may not be discharged.)</p>
<p>unsecured claim - A  claim or debt for which a creditor holds no special assurance of payment, such  as a mortgage or lien; a debt for which credit was extended based solely upon  the creditor's assessment of the debtor's future ability to pay.</p>
<p>V</p>
<p>Voluntary transfer  - A transfer of a debtor's property with the debtor's consent.</p>
