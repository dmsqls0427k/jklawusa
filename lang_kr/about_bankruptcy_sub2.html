<p>Chapter 13</p>
<p>This chapter of the Bankruptcy Code provides  for &quot;adjustment&quot; of debts of an individual with regular income.  Chapter 13 allows a debtor to keep property and pay debts over time, usually  three to five years.</p>
<p>A chapter 13 bankruptcy is also called a  wage earner's plan, although a debtor need not have a job to file chapter  13.&nbsp; It enables individuals with regular  and stable income - from ANY source - to develop a plan to repay all or part of  their debts. Under this chapter, debtors propose a repayment plan to make installments  to creditors over three to five years. While the plan is in effect, the law  forbids creditors from starting or continuing collection efforts.</p>
<p>Chapter 13 offers individuals a number of  advantages over liquidation under chapter 7. Perhaps most significantly,  chapter 13 offers individuals an opportunity to save their homes from  foreclosure. By filing under this chapter, individuals can stop foreclosure  proceedings and may cure delinquent mortgage payments over time. Nevertheless,  they must still make all mortgage payments that come due during the chapter 13  plan, on time. Another advantage of chapter 13 is that it allows individuals to  modify secured debts (other than a mortgage for their primary residence,  generally) and extend them over the life of the chapter 13 plan. Doing this may  lower the payments. Chapter 13 also has a special provision that protects third  parties (like your spouse or a friend) who are liable with the debtor on  &quot;consumer debts.&quot; This provision may protect co-signers. Finally,  chapter 13 acts like a consolidation loan under which the individual makes the  plan payments to a chapter 13 trustee who then distributes payments to  creditors. Individuals will have no direct contact with creditors while under  chapter 13 protection.</p>
<p>Any individual, even if self-employed or operating  an unincorporated business, is eligible for chapter 13 relief as long as the  individual's unsecured debts are less than $307,675 and secured debts are less  than $922,975.&nbsp; These amounts are  adjusted every three years to reflect changes in the consumer price index. A  corporation or partnership may not be a chapter 13 debtor.</p>
<p>In preparing for filing, you must provide  information concerning your income and expenses for the six months prior to the  filing date, and you must be sure that your tax returns are filed.&nbsp; We will also need information on all of your  property and your debts.&nbsp; You must also  have a credit counseling session with a licensed counselor; if you don't have  the session, you can NOT file a bankruptcy case.</p>
<p>How Chapter 13 Works<br />
  Using the information you provide us, we  prepare a series of documents totaling about 30 pages or so, including the  plan.&nbsp; The court charges a fee of  $274.&nbsp; Under certain circumstances, the  court's fee can be paid in installments, but can NOT be waived.&nbsp; Once we file the petition, a meeting is  scheduled with the bankruptcy trustee (called a &quot;341 meeting&quot; or  &quot;first meeting of creditors&quot;) which you MUST attend.&nbsp; We'll go with you, of course!&nbsp; We are with you every step of the way.<br />
  Filing the petition under chapter 13 &quot;automatically  stays&quot; (stops) most collection actions against the debtor or the debtor's  property.&nbsp; Filing the petition does not,  however, stay certain types of actions, and the stay may be effective only for  a short time in some situations. The stay arises by operation of law and  requires no action by a judge. As long as the stay is in effect, creditors  generally may not initiate or continue lawsuits, wage garnishments, or even  make telephone calls demanding payments. The bankruptcy clerk gives notice of the  bankruptcy case to all creditors whose names and addresses are provided by the  debtor.</p>
<p>In a chapter 13 case, to participate in  distributions from the bankruptcy estate, unsecured creditors must file their  claims with the court within 90 days after the first date set for the meeting  of creditors. <br />
  If there are no objections to the plan, the  bankruptcy judge &quot;confirms&quot; the plan, and the trustee then  distributes the funds to creditors according to the terms of the plan, which  may offer some creditors less than full payment on their claims.&nbsp; The plan need not pay unsecured claims in  full as long it provides that the debtor will pay all projected  &quot;disposable income&quot; over an &quot;applicable commitment period,&quot;  and as long as unsecured creditors receive at least as much under the plan as  they would receive if the debtor's assets were liquidated under chapter 7.<br />
  Within 30 days after filing the bankruptcy  case, even if the plan has not yet been approved by the court, the debtor must  start making plan payments to the trustee.&nbsp;  If the court confirms the plan, the chapter 13 trustee will distribute  funds received under the plan &quot;as soon as is practicable.&quot;&nbsp; If the judge refuses to confirm the plan, the  debtor may file a modified plan. </p>
<p>Occasionally, a change in circumstances may  compromise the debtor's ability to make plan payments. For example, a creditor  may object or threaten to object to a plan, or the debtor may inadvertently  have failed to list all creditors. In such instances, the plan may be modified  either before or after confirmation.&nbsp;  Modification after confirmation is not limited to an initiative by the  debtor, but may be at the request of the trustee or an unsecured creditor.</p>
<p>Making the Plan Work - It's up to YOU!<br />
  The provisions of a confirmed plan bind the  debtor and each creditor. Once the court confirms the plan, the debtor must  make the plan succeed. The debtor must make regular payments to the trustee,  which will require adjustment to living on a fixed budget for a prolonged  period. Furthermore, while confirmation of the plan entitles the debtor to  retain property as long as payments are made, the debtor may not incur new debt  without the judge's permission, because additional debt may compromise the  debtor's ability to complete the plan. <br />
  Under some circumstances, a case can be  dismissed.&nbsp; This may happen if you get  behind on your payments to the trustee, you don't file your tax returns, or if  you otherwise fail to follow the rules.&nbsp;  In most cases, we will be there for the full term of your plan to help  you if something goes wrong.</p>
<p>The Chapter 13 Discharge - The &quot;Home  Run&quot;!</p>
<p>When you've made all the payments required  by the plan, the chapter 13 trustee will notify the court and the judge will  issue an Order of Discharge, relieving you of the obligation to pay most of  your debt.&nbsp; The discharge releases the debtor  from all debts provided for by the plan or disallowed, with limited exceptions.  Creditors provided for in full or in part under the chapter 13 plan may no  longer initiate or continue any legal or other action against the debtor to  collect the discharged obligations.</p>
<p>As a general rule, the discharge releases  the debtor from all debts provided for by the plan or disallowed, with the  exception of certain debts. Debts not discharged in chapter 13 include certain  long term obligations (such as a home mortgage), debts for alimony or child support,  certain taxes, debts for most government funded or guaranteed educational loans  or benefit overpayments, debts arising from death or personal injury caused by  driving while intoxicated or under the influence of drugs, and debts for  restitution or a criminal fine included in a sentence on the debtor's  conviction of a crime. To the extent that they are not fully paid under the  chapter 13 plan, the debtor will still be responsible for these debts after the  bankruptcy case has concluded. Debts for money or property obtained by false  pretenses, debts for fraud or defalcation while acting in a fiduciary capacity,  and debts for restitution or damages awarded in a civil case for willful or  malicious actions by the debtor that cause personal injury or death to a person  will be discharged unless a creditor timely files and prevails in an action to  have such debts declared non- dischargeable. <br />
  The discharge in a chapter 13 case is  somewhat broader than in a chapter 7 case. Debts dischargeable in a chapter 13,  but not in chapter 7, include debts for willful and malicious injury to  property (as opposed to a person), debts incurred to pay nondischargeable tax  obligations, and debts arising from property settlements in divorce or  separation proceedings. </p>
<p>A chapter 13 case may be converted to  chapter 7 if circumstances change during the case.</p>
<p>Chapter 13 DISCHARGE (when the plan is done,  and the case is over)</p>
<p>Once the judge issues the Order of  Discharge, most creditors are prohibited from contacting you or trying to collect  a debt that was listed in the bankruptcy plan; the discharge does NOT prevent  collection of new debts.&nbsp; Occasionally, a  creditor will illegally attempt to collect an old debt.&nbsp; If so, you should contact your attorney for  assistance. Because we are usually with you for the full term of your plan,  feel free to call us any time there is a problem.</p>
<p>Debts for child support, alimony, taxes,  student loans and court orders for restitution are among the debts that usually  are NOT discharged.</p>
<p>The discharge does NOT affect the bank's  right to foreclose the mortgage, so you MUST remain current on the mortgage.</p>
<p>Chapter 13 can discharge a few MORE debts  than chapter 7!<br />
  If you think a creditor is illegally trying  to collect a debt from you, let us know and we will take all the&nbsp; appropriate steps to stop the creditor,  including suing the creditor on your behalf.</p>
