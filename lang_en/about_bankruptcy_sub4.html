<p>From the Federal  Trade Commission Website:&nbsp;  http://www.ftc.gov/bcp/edu/pubs/consumer/credit/cre41.shtm</p>
<p>Before You File for  Personal Bankruptcy: <br />
  Information About  Credit Counseling and Debtor Education <br />
  Produced in  cooperation with the Department of Justice&rsquo;s U.S. Trustee Program</p>
<p>The Bankruptcy  Abuse Prevention and Consumer Protection Act of 2005 launched a new era: With  limited exceptions, people who plan to file for bankruptcy protection must get  credit counseling from a government-approved organization within 180 days  before they file. They also must complete a debtor education course to have  their debts discharged.</p>
<p>The Department of  Justice&rsquo;s U.S. Trustee Program approves organizations to provide the mandatory  credit counseling and debtor education. Only the counselors and educators that  appear on the U.S. Trustee Program&rsquo;s lists can advertise that they are, indeed,  approved to provide the required counseling and debtor education. By law, the  U.S. Trustee Program does not operate in Alabama and North Carolina; in these  states, court officials called Bankruptcy Administrators approve pre-bankruptcy  credit counseling organizations and pre-discharge debtor education course  providers.</p>
<p>Counseling and  Education Requirements <br />
  As a rule,  pre-bankruptcy credit counseling and pre-discharge debtor education may not be  provided at the same time. Credit counseling must take place before you file  for bankruptcy; debtor education must take place after you file. <br />
  In general, you  must file a certificate of credit counseling completion when you file for  bankruptcy, and evidence of completion of debtor education after you file for  bankruptcy &ndash; but before your debts are discharged. Only credit counseling  organizations and debtor education course providers that have been approved by  the U.S. Trustee Program may issue these certificates. To protect against  fraud, the certificates are produced through a central automated system and are  numbered.</p>
<p>Pre-bankruptcy  Counseling <br />
  A pre-bankruptcy  counseling session with an approved credit counseling organization should  include an evaluation of your personal financial situation, a discussion of  alternatives to bankruptcy, and a personal budget plan. A typical counseling  session should last about 60 to 90 minutes, and can take place in person, on  the phone, or online. The counseling organization is required to provide the  counseling free of charge for those consumers who cannot afford to pay. If you  cannot afford to pay a fee for credit counseling, you should request a fee  waiver from the counseling organization before the session begins. Otherwise,  you may be charged a fee for the counseling, which will generally be about $50,  depending on where you live, the types of services you receive, and other  factors. The counseling organization is required to discuss any fees with you  before starting the counseling session. </p>
<p>Once you have  completed the required counseling, you must get a certificate as proof. Check  the U.S. Trustee&rsquo;s website to be sure that you receive the certificate from a  counseling organization that is approved in the judicial district where you are  filing bankruptcy. Credit counseling organizations may not charge an extra fee  for the certificate.</p>
<p>Post-Filing Debtor  Education <br />
  A debtor education  course by an approved provider should include information on developing a  budget, managing money, using credit wisely, and other resources. Like  pre-filing counseling, debtor education may be provided in person, on the  phone, or online. The debtor education session might last longer than the  pre-filing counseling &ndash; about two hours &ndash; and the typical fee is between $50  and $100. As with pre-filing counseling, if you are unable to pay the session  fee, you should seek a fee waiver from the debtor education provider. Check the  list of approved debtor education providers at  www.usdoj.gov/ust/eo/bapcpa/ccde/de_approved.htm or at the bankruptcy clerk&rsquo;s  office in your district.</p>
<p>Once you have  completed the required debtor education course, you should receive a  certificate as proof. This certificate is separate from the certificate you  received after completing your pre-filing credit counseling. Check the U.S.  Trustee&rsquo;s website to be sure that you receive the certificate from a debtor  education provider that is approved in the judicial district where you filed  bankruptcy. Unless they have disclosed a charge to you before the counseling  session begins, debtor education providers may not charge an extra fee for the  certificate. </p>
<p>Important Questions  to Ask When Choosing a Credit Counselor <br />
  It&rsquo;s wise to do  some research when choosing a credit counseling organization. If you are in  search of credit counseling to fulfill the bankruptcy law requirements, make  sure you receive services only from approved providers for your judicial  district. Check the list at www.usdoj.gov/ust/eo/bapcpa/ccde/cc_approved.htm or  at the bankruptcy clerk&rsquo;s office for the district where you will file. Once you  have the list of approved organizations in your judicial district, call several  to gather information before you make your choice. Some key questions to ask  are:</p>
<p>What services do  you offer? </p>
<p>Will you help me  develop a plan for avoiding problems in the future? </p>
<p>What are your fees? </p>
<p>What if I can&rsquo;t  afford to pay your fees? </p>
<p>What qualifications  do your counselors have? Are they accredited or certified by an outside  organization? What training do they receive? </p>
<p>What do you do to  keep information about me (including my address, phone number, and financial  information) confidential and secure? </p>
<p>How are your  employees paid? Are they paid more if I sign up for certain services, if I pay  a fee, or if I make a contribution to your organization?</p>
<p>For More  Information and Assistance <br />
  The U.S. Trustee  Program promotes integrity and efficiency in the nation&rsquo;s bankruptcy system by  enforcing bankruptcy laws, providing oversight of private trustees, and  maintaining operational excellence. The Program has 21 regions and 95 field  offices, and oversees the administration of bankruptcy in all states except  Alabama and North Carolina. For more information, visit www.usdoj.gov/ust.</p>
